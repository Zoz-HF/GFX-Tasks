# Getting Started with OpenGL

This C++ program uses the OpenGL library to draw various shapes, including characters and polygons. It provides a simple graphical representation using OpenGL primitives (`GL_POLYGON`, `GL_TRIANGLE_FAN`, `GL_LINE_LOOP`).

## Features

- Draws a polygon with specified vertices counterclockwise.
- Displays the characters 'S,' 'B,' and 'E.'
- Draws a more curved heart shape.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ development environment (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio)
- OpenGL (GLEW and FreeGLUT)

## Controls

Press the 'Esc' key to exit the program.

## Sample Output

The program will display graphical representations of characters and shapes in an OpenGL window.
