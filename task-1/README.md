# Getting Started with OpenGL

This C++ program uses the OpenGL library to draw various shapes, including characters and polygons. It provides a simple graphical representation using OpenGL primitives.


## Features

- Draws a polygon with specified vertices counterclockwise.
- Displays the characters 'S,' 'B,' and 'E.'
- Draws a more curved heart shape.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have the following installed:

- OpenGL (GLEW and FreeGLUT)
- C++ development environment (e.g., GCC, Visual C++, or Xcode)


## Controls
Press the 'Esc' key to exit the program.

## Sample Output

The program will display graphical representations of characters and shapes in an OpenGL window.
