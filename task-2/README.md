# Composing a Scene & Drawing a Leaf 

In the 2nd task, we have taken the fundamentals learned in Task 1 and applied them to create a more complex scene. This scene includes a house and various elements like sun, tree and cloud-like spiral shape. We also introduced the detailed drawing of a leaf.

## 1. Composing the Scene

We have used a **transformer-core** shape as out starting point for the house structure. It's worth mentioning that we have  constructed this shape using the least number of triangles.
