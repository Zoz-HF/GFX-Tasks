# Getting Started with OpenGL

In this task, we have used the OpenGL library to draw various shapes, including characters and polygons. It provides a simple graphical representation using OpenGL primitives (`GL_POLYGON`, `GL_TRIANGLE_FAN`, `GL_LINE_LOOP`).


## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ development environment (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio)
- OpenGL (GLEW and FreeGLUT)


## Sample Output

The program will display graphical representations of characters and shapes in an OpenGL window.

## Acknowledgments

This code is provided as a basic example of using OpenGL for drawing shapes. Feel free to modify and expand upon it for your own projects.
